              </div>
     </a>
        <p>This was our very first project in this class. We each created a short  introduction of ourselves with our various backgrounds and goals we hope to achieve in this class.</p>

     </a>
        <p>For this making we used our knowledge from the first project to produce something even more thourough and varying designs. I used this opportunity to explore different font and background colors as well as playing with different picture size, alignment, and placment.</p>

              </div>
     </a>
        <p>For this project we were tasked to create a non linear design. Meaning a layout that extends and changes over multiple pages. I used this opportunity to create a somewhat interactive interface that promtps users about how they are feeling. With this project I was able to explore different layouts and making sure themes and media is consistent over multiple pages. </p>

    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
           <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
  <p>So far in this course  I have been able to explore a multitude of different media and approaches that have widely broadened my knowledge of different design aspects and attributes. Exploring through the numerous readings and resources availble in this class, I was able to understand the fundamentals and cruical points when it comes to making digital media and interactive platforms.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
  <p>The layout and approach of this class makes it very easy to interact with peers and not only help  eachother but gain knowledge from one another. We all have come into this course with different skill sets and goals in mind, but I think that is something that contributes to the beauty of this class. Numerous times have I found myself seeking help from my peers and they have been able to point me in the right direction. What is fascinating to me is seeing how people incorporate the basics of designs differently from on another and the infinte number of different projects that could be made.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
  <p>So far this course has truly helped me explore my deepest thoughts and dig deep into my creative flow. With the first set of projects being somewhat variations of one another, each time I felt like I the need to dig a little deeper within myself to create something that is both meaningful but also educational or informative. I realized that while making these projects, there is truly endless posibilities and I really love that aspect of it. When you truly think about it there are so many small details, from font theme to picture placment and word allignment there are so many small things that could ultimately make or break a design. </p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
  <p>In just a few weeks I have greatly learned about the numerous design aspects that go into making these types of projects. I think the skill I have refined the most so far is definetly using the Atom interface. Prior to taking this class I had a limited knowledge of coding especially its use for design. However in under a month I am now able to identify different types of code and know how it would be presented on a website or interface. As the course goes on I plan to dive deeply into the various resources availble and polish my design and coding skills to the fullest.  </p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
  <p>While I feel quite confident when presentimg my work, I believe that I have a few areas of improvment to work on. Firstly I think that I should enunciate and project my words alot more. Secondly I feel like I could definelty put much more energy into my speech delivery. I think I often have great ideas and piece them well together but the struggle comes alive when its time to demonstrate my ideas how I portrayed them </p>

          <p>During this project I had the chance to explore the multitude of tools that Adobe Premier Pro offers, and use them to make special effects and add a special touch to my future projects.</p>

          <p>This project has been a good continuation of the previous project. I was able to deepen my understanding of the amazing array of tools availble in Premiere Pro and create an even more complex animation.</p>

         <p>For this project I used Adobe Character Creator. I was able to explore and play around with the various tools the software offers. It was exciting to be abe to create my own character and make it move and speak whichever way I wanted. It was quite the nostalgic experince as it resembles alot the animation style of many of the early cartoons I grew up watching. </p>

     <h3 class="margin">Phase 2/3 Course Goals</h3>

  <h4><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p>One project after the other I have had to dig deep into different souces of inspiration adn create a compilation of whatever I would be feeling at that particular time. I have seen my creative process and execution truly progress and evolve over the course of these few weeks. Thus, I belive the various projects I have made are a testimony to this process.</p>
     <br>
        <h4><em>2.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p>Making these various projects themsleves was a major part of the fufillment and satisfaction gained, but a critical component that make this memorable was helping each other out and being able to learn and inspire one another. As indiviudals we each came into this class with different ways of thinking and vieiwing the multiple aspects of life. Yet, we are able to come together despite these differences, and utilize them in a way that is benecial and constuvtie to everyone else. We were eached tasked with the same projects, but we all produced different outputs and that is only part of the beauty that comes with working and enaging with others in this workshop style enviornment.  </p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p>Being presented with all these different projects I often had to take a step back and think about the overall context of the project and what would be most apporpriate to make in that context. However thinking about these things tends to lead you down even more rabbitholes where the possibilities are endless. When faced with making art or just looking at an art piece, there are infinte number of reasons as to why the artist would have made this piece. The true beauty of art, in all its forms, is that ultimately it is meant to be reacted to. Art need to be seen, touched, and heard by the audience, and it is often their reaction that encorportates the beauty of that artwork. Art is extremely subjective, and thinking deeply about craft has helped me understand this.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
  <p>As we have been prompted with more complex tasks and projects to complete, I have often turned to many online blogs or Youtube videos to help me navigate through obstacles and deepen my understanding of the various tools and software I was presented with. While doing the research for my final project, I have also been able to learn effective notetaking skills to filter the most adequate and useful information for my final product.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p>With having made all these different projects, and using all these different softwares and components available, I have truly learned to become more confidennt and resilient about my work. This has led to me feeling less stressed and overwhemling when it comes to displaying and presenting my work in front of other people..</p>
